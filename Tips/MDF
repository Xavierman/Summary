* Put forward a noval visual saliency model with CNNs
  * multiscale feature extraction
    * regions A from entire image (use Hierarchical image segmentation) -> cnn *3 -> fc *3 -> feature A
    * regions B from regions A (use Hierarchical image segmentation) -> cnn *3 -> fc *3 -> feature B
    * regions C from regions B (use Hierarchical image segmentation) -> cnn *3 -> fc *3 -> feature C
  * cost fuction
    * 
  * Efficacy
    * S-3CNN multiscale feature obtain the details (feature maps are get from multiscale regions and be extended to 227*227)
    * Multilevel Decomposition, fused model performs better
